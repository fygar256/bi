# bi
Binary file editor like vI - bi

This is a binary file editor with an interface similar to vi. It started when I uploaded it to ASCII-net for MS-DOS in December 1991. 34 years have passed since then. In 1996, Gerhard Buergmann released bvi, which was created for Linux with an interface similar to vi, but I was the first to do so. The version for MS-DOS is complete, but I am currently working on upgrading it for Linux.

The first version was written in C, but this version is written in Python.

There are still some glitches here and there, but it's an alpha version.
