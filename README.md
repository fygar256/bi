Binary editor like vI - bi

bi is a binary editor with a user interface similar to vi. It started when I posted it on ASCII-net for MS-DOS in December 1991. 33 years have passed since then. Another binary editor with a user interface similar to vi was released for Linux in 1996 by Gerhard Buergmann, called bvi, but I was the first. The first version of bi was written in C, but the currently released version is written in python.

It uses ANSI terminal escape sequences, so it is for ANSI terminals. I think it will run on python and on Linux, FreeBSD, unix, and POSIX-compliant OS with ANSI terminal.

The bi is designed to be with high functionality, flexible, lightweight, simple, compact, user-friendly and smoothly responsive. bi can handle original script.

The development environment and operation verification are done on ArchLinux.

Overview
--------

    BI is a binary editor designed to mimic the interface of the
    UNIX editor 'vi'. The name (BI) is an abbreviation for Binary editor
	like vI. For the vi and binary enthusiasts.

Remarks

    Regular expression can be used for string search.
    '/' can be escaped with escape character '\' in regular expression.

    Comment can be written in command with '#'. You have to write command
    including semicolon with escape character '\'.

    The values enclosed with `[]` can be left out, when these commands
    above take the current position as the value omitted.
    But when the values such as start and end are omitted in 's' command,
    's' command will affect entire file.

    The value <end> can be passed with '*<length>' as <end>=<start>+<length>-1.

    On command line, you've got to give values by simple expression as
    followings.

        <expression> := <factor> | <factor> [+|-] <factor>

    factor is a number in hexadecimal or decimal with prefix '#'.
    And you can also give values with '[a-z] as marked position,
    0 as the top of file, . as the current position, and $ as the bottom
    of file. Python eval() expression is what is enclosed with '{}'.
    You can give values like this {0xff^0x55}.
    Also, you can give the value of file as mem[x] in {}, x can be specified
    to current position 'cp'.

    The v command has a bit of a quirk. It deletes data from <start> to <end>
    and moves it to <dest>, but if dest==filesize, the deleted data is moved
    to the end of the data + 1, and if dest>filesize, it fills from the end of
    the file + 1 to dest with 0s, and writes the deleted data from dest.

    ^L switches multi-byte boundary from 0 to 3. if utf-8 multi-byte characters
    are not seen, press ^L several times.

    ^Y toggles utf-8 display mode. Initial value is disable. When the screen
    is disturbed by utf-8 encode error, you can disable it with pressing ^Y.

Scripting functionality

    bi has Scripting functionality.
    bi sctipt is named 'file.bi'. The command line synopsis of specificaton
    of script file is like that: 'bi [-v] -s file.bi targetfile'

Python exec
    The python exec() is Turing complete therefore, with '@'
    command, everything is able to be written.

    For example, in new file situation, production for the file including
    0~255 repeated 4times of 1024 bytes can be written like this:

    :@for i in range(1024):\n    setmem(i,i%256) # 0~255 repeat 4 times

    If you import modules, they will be located bi's global space.

Speed up
    If you need for bi to be higher speed, you can compile bi.py with
    pyinstaller like this: pyinstaller --onefile bi.py

â˜…Attention

    It doesn't support undo command yet.

Danger
    With '@' command, if you rewrite global variable of bi with 'global <var>'
    and '<var>=<some value>', it might destroy bi system and cause python
    system error. So be careful when you rewrite global variable of bi.
