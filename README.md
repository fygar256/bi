Binary editor like vI - bi

bi is a binary file editor with a user interface similar to vi. It started when I posted it on ASCII-net for MS-DOS in December 1991. 33 years have passed since then. Another binary editor with a user interface similar to vi was released for Linux in 1996 by Gerhard Buergmann, called bvi, but I was the first. The first version of bi was written in C, but the currently released version 3.0.0 is for Linux and written in python.

It uses ANSI terminal escape sequences, so it is for ANSI terminals. I think it will run on python and on Linux, FreeBSD, unix, and POSIX-compliant OS with ANSI terminal.

The bi is designed to be with high functionality, flexible, lightweight, simple, compact and smoothly responsive. bi can handle original script.

The development environment and operation verification are done on ArchLinux.

                   vi like binary editor 'bi'

                   Programmed by T.Maekawa (fygar256)

Overview
--------

    BI is a binary editor designed to mimic the interface of the
    UNIX editor 'vi'. The name (BI) is an abbreviation for Binary editor
	like vI. For the vi and binary enthusiasts.

Remarks

    Regular expression can be used for string search.
    '/' can be escaped with escape character '\' in regular expression.

    Comment can be written in command with ';'. You have to write command
    including semicolon with escape character '\'.

    The values enclosed with `[]` can be left out, when these commands 
    above take the current position as the value omitted.

    The value <end> can be passed with '%<length>' as <end>=<start>+<length>-1.

    On command line, you've got to give values by simple expression as 
    followings.

        <expression> := <factor> [+|-] <factor>

    factor is a number in hexadecimal or decimal with prefix '#'. 
    And you can also give values with '[a-z] as marked position,
    0 as the top of file, . as the current position, and $ as the bottom
    of file.

    The m command has a bit of a quirk. It deletes data from <start> to <end>
    and moves it to <dest>, but if dest==filesize, the deleted data is moved
    to the end of the data + 1, and if dest>filesize, it fills from the end of
    the file + 1 to dest with 0s, and writes the deleted data from dest.

    the functions marked with `@` are not implemented yet.

Scripting functionality

    bi has Scripting functionality.
    bi sctipt is named 'file.bi'. The command line synopsis of specificaton
    of script file is like that: 'bi [-v] -s file.bi targetfile'

â˜…Attention

    It doesn't support undo command yet.
