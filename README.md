Binary editor like vI - bi

This is a binary editor with an interface similar to vi. It started when I uploaded it to ASCII-net for MS-DOS in December 1991. 33 years have passed since then. In 1996, Gerhard Buergmann released bvi, which was created for Linux with an interface similar to vi, but I was the first to do so. The version for MS-DOS is complete. 2nd version of linux is completed on 2025-04-04.

The first version was written in C,this version is written in Python.
