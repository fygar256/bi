Binary file editor like vI - bi

This is a binary file editor with an interface similar to vi. It started when I uploaded it to ASCII-net for PC-9801 in December 1991. 34 years have passed since then. In 1996, Gerhard Buergmann released bvi, which was created for Linux with an interface similar to vi, but I was the first to do so. The version for MS-DOS is complete, but I am currently working on upgrading it for Linux.
