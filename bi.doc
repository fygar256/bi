Remarks

    Regular expression can be used for string search.
    '/' can be escaped with escape character '\' in regular expression.

    Comment can be written in command with ';'. You have to write command
    including semicolon with escape character '\'.

    The values enclosed with `[]` can be left out, when these commands
    above take the current position as the value omitted.
    But when the values such as start and end are omitted in 's' command,
    's' command will affect entire file.

    The value <end> can be passed with '%<length>' as <end>=<start>+<length>-1.

    On command line, you've got to give values by simple expression as
    followings.

        <expression> := <factor> | <factor> [+|-] <factor>

    factor is a number in hexadecimal or decimal with prefix '#'.
    And you can also give values with '[a-z] as marked position,
    0 as the top of file, . as the current position, and $ as the bottom
    of file. Python eval() expression is what is enclosed with '{}'.
    You can give values like this {0xff^0x55}.

    The v command has a bit of a quirk. It deletes data from <start> to <end>
    and moves it to <dest>, but if dest==filesize, the deleted data is moved
    to the end of the data + 1, and if dest>filesize, it fills from the end of
    the file + 1 to dest with 0s, and writes the deleted data from dest.

    ^L switches multi-byte boundary from 0 to 2. if utf-8 multi-byte characters
    are not seen, press ^L several times.

    ^Y toggles utf-8 display mode. Initial value is disable. When the screen
    is disturbed by utf-8 encode error, you can disable it with pressing ^Y.

    The functions marked with `@` are not implemented yet.

Scripting functionality

    bi has Scripting functionality.
    bi sctipt is named 'file.bi'. The command line synopsis of specificaton
    of script file is like that: 'bi [-v] -s file.bi targetfile'

Speed up
    If you need for bi to be higher speed, you can compile bi.py with
    pyinstaller like this: pyinstaller --onefile bi.py

â˜…Attention

    It doesn't support undo command yet.
